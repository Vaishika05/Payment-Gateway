# Payment Gateway API

A simple backend payment processing API using Node.js, Express, and MongoDB. It mimics basic transaction handling like a lightweight version of a payment gateway (e.g., GPay, Razorpay), focusing on **data integrity** and **fault tolerance** mechanisms.

## Features Implemented

-   🔐 **Idempotency support**
    -   Prevents duplicate transactions using a unique key per request.
    -   Ensures safe retry of payment calls without duplicating records.
-   🗃️ **MongoDB integration** with Mongoose
-   🧪 **Basic payment route** (`POST /api/payment`)
    -   Accepts amount and idempotencyKey
    -   Randomly sets `status` (success/failure)
    -   Saves transaction to database
